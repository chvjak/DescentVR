        PSLIB is a system for librarying files.  We can combine data
        files into one library, saving disk space and simplifying
        distribution of demos, etc.

        The system consists of two parts, a program to create libraries
        and a routine to read from the libraries.


        The old way:
        -----------

        In order to extract the file from the library, the extract function is
        called.  The format is as follows:

        extract ( <name of library to extract files from>,
                  <filename to extract>,
                  <buffer to extract to> );

        The improved and current method:
        -------------------------------

        In order to extract a file from the library, we first initialize
        our library file with lib_init(filename);

        This opens our library file, verifies that it is a PSLB file,
        and reads the headers into a global array.

        LibReadFile() reads the desired filename from the library and returns
        the data in a buffer.  This is identical in format to the
        function ReadFile() in readfile.h.

        Once the library is opened, we can call LibReadFile() multiple
        times.

        After all the data files desired are read lib_close() is called
        to close our library file.
